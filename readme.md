# Wah!Cade - Focus layout v0.1

![Sega Megadrive games in Focus layout.](http://i.imgur.com/rxb9BjI.jpg)

A minimalistic layout to be used in Wah!Cade, an emulator launcher. It's
intended to be used in big TVs (32 inches or above) so maybe you need to change
font sizes if you want to use it in smaller screens.
